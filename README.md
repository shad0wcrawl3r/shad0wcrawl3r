### Hi, I'm Ashwin ([shadowcrawl3r][website])
[website]: https://ashwinbelbase.com.np

About Me:
><li> Studied Computer Networking and Security</li>
><li> Working as a SIEM Engineer, mainly with Elastic Stack</li>
><li> Will spend an aentire week automating stuff rather than spend 5 minutes to do it manually.</li>
><li> Will keep all my repos private because my code writing style sucks.
><li> Love to be lazy</li>  
><li> I get bored easily</li>

What I can do:
><li> Python</li>
><li> Linux/Bash</li>
><li> Docker, fed up because most apps require systemd now and systemd+docker=not good</li>
><li> Node.js, left because I could not deal with promises</li> 

My projects:
><li>Built an OS by myself using LFS just to scrap everything and use debian because my supervisor wanted a package manager</li>
><li>Built a Discord bot in node.js and discontinued because I got tired of node.js promises</li>
><li>Bunch of mini-scripts to make my life easier at work.
