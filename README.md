What I can do:
><li> Python</li>
><li> Linux/Bash</li>
><li> Docker, fed up because most apps require systemd now and systemd+docker=not good</li>
><li> Node.js, left because I could not deal with promises</li>

My projects:
><li>Built an OS by myself using LFS just to scrap everything and use debian because my supervisor wanted a package manager</li>
><li>Built a Discord bot in node.js and discontinued because I got tired of node.js promises</li>
><li>Bunch of mini-scripts to make my life easier at work.
What I am doing currently:
><li>Working as a SIEM Engineer at Vairav Technology.</li>
